(OSHWM is the value given to the default value of Basic PAGE, ie: *SAVE TRACK 1900 +A00).Example: *REPAIR 0 1CTrack 1C, sector 0, OKÝ Ý Data savedTrack 1C, sector 1, OKÝ Ý Data savedTrack 1C, sector 2, Data CRC errorÝ Ý Data savedTrack 1C, sector 3, OKÝ Ý Data savedTrack 1C, sector 4, OKÝ Ý Data savedTrack 1C, sector 5, ID CRC errorÝ Ý Data lostTrack 1C, sector 6, Sector not foundÝ Ý Data lostTrack 1C, sector 7, OKÝ Ý Data savedTrack 1C, sector 8, OKÝ Ý Data savedTrack 1C, sector 9, OKÝ Ý Data savedRepair this track ?
