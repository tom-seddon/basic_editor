The rom version will not respond.*BLISTThe current language rom in the BBC I/O processor must be BASIC. Z80 Basic is not supported.*DISSDISS only disassembles memory in the BBC I/O processor, nor does it support the 65C02 extended instruction set.*MEDITMEDIT always shows and edits the memory in the I/O processor, not that in the second processor.*MOVEMOVE only moves memory in the I/O processor.*ROMIDAll addresses in ROMID are in the I/O processor only.*SPACEDoes not respond at all.*VLISTA special version of VLIST is provided on the PROBE2 disk for 6502 second processors. The rom version will not respond.bpOC27,33,0,27,69PROBE2-disk commands for 6502 Second Processors.OC27,33,1The disc supplied contains versions of BASED and VLIST that will run in the 6502 second processor:-oc27,71*BASEDoc27,72ÝThe Rom does not respond  and a small disc file is loaded. This checks that the current Language is BASIC, and which version of Basic it is. The correct version of the editor is then loaded after checking there is room for it.*B3ÝBASED for Hi-Basic 3.1: Loads to &9E00, ie. under the Basic.*B2ÝBASED for BASIC 2. Loads to &DE00, ie. as high as possible above Basic and below the OS.oc27,71*VLISToc27,72ÝThe Rom does not respond  and a small disc file is loaded. This checks that the current Language is BASIC, and which version of Basic it is. The correct version of VLIST is then loaded after checking there is room for it.*V3ÝVLIST for Hi-Basic 3.1. Loads to &B400.*V2ÝVLIST for BASIC 2. Loads to &F400.If the current Basic version is known, ie BASIC 2 or Hi-Basic, the correct versions can be run directly by *B2 or *V3 etc.Once run from disc and having exited back to Basic, the Editor or Vlist can be re-entered by *GO, ( no execution address is required).oc27,71Abbreviations:OC27,72Some abbreviations are supported by the disk, viz: *BASED, *B *VLIST, *VL.oc27,71ERRORS:oc27,72Not TubeThe new versions will not run in the normal BBC memory.Not BasicThe current Language in the second processor is not BASIC 2 or Hi-Basic.No roomThere is insufficent room to load the code. This could be due to the top of the variable space being too high, in which case try CLEAR and *B again.
