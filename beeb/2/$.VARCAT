No option will list all the variables.Errors: "Not BASIC"- Cannot be used if the current language rom is not BASIC, ie VIEW, WORDWISE etc.Note that LOCAL variables in PROC/FN's which are not the same as any Global will appear with zero values. ESCAPE however during a PROC/FN that uses a local variable of the same name as a global one will leave the global with the local value, the global value being lost.
