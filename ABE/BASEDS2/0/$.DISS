This allows code to be disassembled from a position it does not normally run from, ie: *DISS 3000 8000 could disassemble a rom image residing at &3000 but make the addresses appear as if the code were actually at &8000.OC27,33,0,27,69*DISS address @pageSelects the given rom page when the address is the region &8000 to &BFFF, allowing the disassembly of a resident sideways rom, ie:*DISS 8000 @Cwill disassemble the rom in page C.Select paged mode (Ctrl N) or printer output (Ctrl B) as required, before using *DISS.
