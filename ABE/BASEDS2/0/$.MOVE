The values of PAGE, LOMEM and TOP are adjusted to suit.2:||||OC27,33,0,27,69*MOVE <page>OC27,33,1   Moves the current program to the given value of page. The value is rounded down to the nearest page boundry, ie:нн*MOVE 1130will move the program to PAGE = &1100.The values of PAGE, LOMEM and TOP are adjusted to suit.If there is insufficent room between <page> and HIMEM for the program, the program will not be moved and an error message "Bad Address" given.3:||||OC27,33,0,27,69*MOVE < Destination >< Source >< Finish >OC27,33,1 Moves the block of memory between Source and Finish to the given destination address ,ie:нн*MOVE 34F0 2A16 2F34will move the area of memory between &2A16 and &2F34 up to &34F0...Note that this is exclusive of the finish address itself (as in *SAVE etc.)4:||||OC27,33,0,27,69*MOVE < Destination >< Source >< +Extent >OC27,33,1 In this case the number of bytes to be moved is given by the Extent. ie:нн*MOVE 34F0 1A16 +1C3will move &1C3 bytes from &1A16 up to &34F0.There is no restriction on any of the addresses in the last two forms of MOVE. All the moves are "intelligent", such that source memory is not overwritten before being moved.
