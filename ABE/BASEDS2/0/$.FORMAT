Both drive number and tracks oc27,52MUST oc27,53be given (in decimal).Any number of tracks may be formatted. (Normally 40 or 80).OC27,33,0,27,69*FORMAT < drive >< tracks > DOC27,33,1Format the disk on both sides, eg:Ý Ý*FORMAT 1 80 DWill format the disc in drive 1 for 80 tracks on both sides.If the disk is not new, the message-"Disk already formatted, ok to reformat?_"will appear, only Y (or y) is accepted as yes, any other key will cause the format to be abandoned before writing to the disk. The disc is normally verified as it is formatted, and the track numbers displayed (in hex). A "?" after a track number means the track had to be reread/reformatted before it passed as OK, and may therefore be suspect.OC27,33,0,27,69*FORMAT < drive >< tracks > VOC27,33,1Format without Verifying.To quickly reformat a disc known to be good, the normal verify can be defeated by adding a 'V'.As FORMAT uses no user ram space outside the normal disc buffers, a disc may be formatted at any time without overwriting any program or text (Wordwise/View etc.)Errors: Drive numbers other than 0-3 will cause "Bad drive". Tracks less than 1 or more than 255 will cause "Bad track#".T'notes: Uses bytes &A0 to &AB in page 0 and all page &F (normal sector buffer for Acorn DFS series 0.9x and 1.x).
