Other DFS makes cannot be guaranteed, although both Watford and Amcom DFSs have been tested and appear to be compatible.OC27,33,0,27,69Command parameters:OC27,33,1Most of the utilities take one or more parameters following the command name. Parameters must be seperated from the command name, and from each other, by at least one space. Those parameters that are optional are shown in the summary and by *HELP, enclosed in parentheses (). Compulsary parameters are shown in angle brackets <>.OC27,33,0,27,69Second Processors:OC27,33,1If using a second processor on the Tube, please read the special instructions at the end of this book.ce***********************ce(C) I.Wilson and M.Yell 1984ceAltra Romsce209 North StreetceLeeds 7
