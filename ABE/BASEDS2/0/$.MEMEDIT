Therefore if the catalogue sectors are corrupt or incorect, or the disk is not standard Acorn format, the number of tracks should be given, in decimal, with drive and sector no.OC27,33,0,27,69DISPLAY Mode:OC27,33,1is 40 or 80 column, depending on the screen mode on entry:- Modes 0,1,2,3 will select 80 columns in mode 3, modes 4,5,6,7 select 40 column in mode 7. 40 column mode is useful for editing catalogue sectors or with TV displays. 80 column mode shows an entire sector on screen without scrolling.On entry the start sector is read in and displayed. The cursor will  be on the hex side, byte 00, and shown as a flashing block. This is EDIT mode.OC27,33,0,27,69EDIT mode KEYSOC27,33,1in9ti0TAB›Move cursor between Hex and Ascii sides of the screen.ti0CURSOR Keys oc27,75,8,0,16,32,64,255,64,32,16,0 OC27,75,8,0,8,4,2,255,2,4,8,0 OC27,75,8,0,16,56,84,146,16,16,16,0 OC27,75,8,0,16,16,16,146,84,56,16,0Move cursor around the current side of the screen, Hex or Ascii.

Y/N". If you wish to write the sector back press "Y", any other key will cause the pending sector change to be executed.The prompt "Write sector# ? (CR=origin)" will appear. Return will write the sector back to its original sector. If you wish to write it elsewhere enter either:The absolute hex sector number (CR), ie: 12F  or,Track/Sector (cr), both in hex, ie: 30/3Confirmation is then required to the prompt: "Writing T/S TO t/s, OK?".Any key except "Y" will return to the "Write sector ?" prompt. If successfully written, the pending sector change will be executed.If the write fails, the error is shown on the error line at the top of the screen and the prompt "Try again Y/N?" appears. Only "Y" will reattempt the write.OC27,33,0,27,69COMMAND ModeOC27,33,1 The cursor appears normal on the bottom line, with the prompt:"SECTOR ? <CR=next>_"OC27,33,0,27,69COMMAND mode KEYSOC27,33,1RETURN›Read next sector.IN9TI0COPY›Repeat the last function, ie reread the current sector, or go back to write mode.IN0SHIFT-Cursors  Change sector or track, as for Edit mode.ESCAPE›Exit disk editor.Alternativly an absolute sector number or Track/Sector number can be given, ie:12F would read sector &12F1F/9 would read track &1F, sector 9.No check is made on the sector number in track/sector type input, allowing non standard sector numbers to be read/written. Note that the next/previous sector commands and absolute sector# assume normal Acorn format, sectors numbered 0-9.bpOC27,33,0,27,69ERRORSOC27,33,1If an error occurs during a read or write, the error is reported at the top ofthe screen, and command mode is entered. The system tries 3 times before reporting an error. If the error is "fatal", ie sector not found, no data will be displayed for a read. "COPY" can be used to try the function again if required.If "deleted data" is encountered, the choice of writing the sector back as normal or deleted is offered.OC27,33,0,27,69TYPICAL SCREEN DISPLAYOC27,33,0
