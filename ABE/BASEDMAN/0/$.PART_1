Some of the utilities includedin the package will also assist in the debugging of BASIC programs orthe recovery of programs from corrupted media.The "tool set" includes facilities for moving and copying blocks ofprogram lines with automatic renumbering of GOTO statements; globalprogram renumbering or renumbering of selected blocks with automaticrenumbering of GOTO statements; global or selective search and replacefacilities for strings; and packing/unpacking facilities to assistwith memory useage versus legibility of programs. In addition crossreference tables can be generated for variables, procedures, functionsand GOTO's listing all of the associated program line numbers.The editor forms the main desk-top environment for the creation of anew program or editing of an existing program loaded from a disk ortape filing-system. The editor includes rudimentary move, copy,renumber, search and replace facilities which are accessible from thecommand screen.More advanced utilities are available from a separate utilities menu,obtained by entering UTILS from the editor's command screen or *BUTIL(*B) either from the editor's command screen or directly from BASIC.These facilities include features such as automatic adjustment ofGOTO's and generation of cross reference tables. These utilities aredescribed in sections 3.2 to 3.7.  Finally a small number of additional utilities have to be accessedseparately, some of them directly from BASIC. These include facilitiesto list the current dynamic values of selected program  variables andfacilities for manipulating useage of the computer's memory space tobest advantage. These utilities are detailed in sections 3.8 to 3.15.The Advanced BASIC Editor is a language in its own right and wheninvoked it replaces the BASIC language that is called up by default atPOWER-UP. It is invoked by entering *BE at the BASIC prompt and isdescribed in detail in section 2 of this manual. Entering EXIT fromthe command screen or FUNC Q [f9] from the  edit screen reinstatesBASIC. The most useful utilities have been grouped together under amenu system which is accessed by entering *B from BASIC or the ABE orby entering "UTILS" from the ABE command screen. Other utilities areaccessed separately.Although the main utilities menu includes rudimentary facilities forentering and viewing text, it is envisaged that this will be doneusually from within the main editor, the utilities only being accessedoccasionally. Note if any existing program is "LOAD"ed from a filing system into theAdvanced BASIC Editor, the filename is remembered so that backups canbe made by simply entering "UPDATE" from the command screen. However,if the user exits the editor in order to access any of the utilitiesthe filename is lost. Further backups can only be made with the "SAVE<filename>" command.ÄPE*HELP BE or *H.BE lists the main utilities as follows :-	BUTIL	BLIST <fsp>	CLR	FKEYS [key]	MOVE page|ssss ffff|+eeee dddd	ROMID       SPACE 	TXCOPY	VLIST [HR$%PF]*BUTIL (or *B) is the command that invokes the main utilities menu(sections 3.2 to 3.7). The other commands are explained in sections3.8 to 3.15.To exit the Advanced BASIC Editor Utilities menu; "ESCAPE" returns theuser to the Advanced BASIC Editor command screen; "Q" returns the userto BASIC.Any of the "*" commands can include a "P" prefix in order todistinguish them from commands on other ROMs of the same name. e.g.*PMOVE will distinguish the ABE MOVE utility from any other MOVEutility.This manual has been written for the Acorn Electron user and functionkey commands refer to the "ELK" (e.g. FUNC U to UNDO the last change)however for the benefit of users who are familiar with the BBC Microand Acornsoft's "BASIC Editor" we have included the BBC Microequivalents (as denoted by enclosure in square brackets ) e.g. [SHIFTf2] is the BBC Micro equivalent of "UNDO".ÄPE
