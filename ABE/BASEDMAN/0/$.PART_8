This is the second pin downon the right hand side, looking at the MODULE with the small notchat the top and the pins facing away from you.NOTEThe Cartridge version has a spare 16K ROM socket. This can be usedfor any normal type of ROM. The notch of the EPROM must be pointingtowards the gold fingers. To gain access to the spare socket, thetwo screws visible in the front of the cartridge case, must beremoved.CARTRIDGESThe cartridge can be fitted to either the ELECTRON or MASTER. Tofit, first turn off the power. (Damage can be caused if thecartridge is inserted or removed with the power on!) Insert thecartridge into either slot, with the label facing you. Turn on andtype *HELP. A list of ROM titles should appear. If THE ADVANCEDBASIC EDITOR is not listed check that the CARTRIDGE is fittedcorrectly.NOTETHE ADVANCED BASIC EDITOR is a language. With the ELECTRON, whenswitched on, the ABE might be entered automatically. If this is notacceptable contact PRES Ltd. who will be able to tell you how toavoid this situation. MODULESFor The BBC Computer.After turning off the power, take off the top cover of the computerby removing the four fixing screws located at the rear of thecomputer and on the underside near the front. Now locate the ROMsockets, just under the right hand side of the keyboard for the BBCand to the right of the power supply for the BBC+. The two socketsnearest the front, in the BBC+, are for the speech synthesizer andshould not be used. For the BBC you will need to remove the screwssecuring the keyboard and then move it carefully to one side.Insert the ABE module into one of the empty ROM sockets with the little notch on the end of the EPROM, facing the rear of themachine. Take great care when fitting, not to bend any of the pinsof the MODULE. (See the Warning above) Refit the keyboard and case. ÄPEFOR THE MASTERAfter turning off the power, take off the top cover of the computerby removing the four fixing screws located underneath. Locate thefour ROM sockets, situated at the right hand side. The socketnearest the rear should be already occupied. Insert the MODULE intoone of the free sockets, making sure that the little notch on theend of the EPROM, is pointing to the right hand side. Take greatcare when fitting, not to bend any of the pins of the MODULE. (Seethe Warning above) Refit the case.NOTEThe ABE MODULE will not work with ROM expansion boards fitted thethe MASTER. FOR THE MASTER COMPACTAfter turning off the power, take off the top cover of the computerby removing the four fixing screws located on the underneath at thetwo ends. Raise the top half of the computer a few inches androtate through 90 degrees and lower gently to rest on the bottomhalf of the computer. The five ROM sockets are  situated at theright hand side. The socket nearest the front should be alreadyoccupied. Insert the MODULE into one of the free sockets, makingsure that the little notch on the end of the EPROM, is pointing tothe left hand side. Take great care when fitting, not to bend anyof the pins of the MODULE. (See the Warning above) Refit the case.FOR THE ELECTRONThe electron must be fitted with a PLUS 1 and AP6 or a SLOGGER ROMBOX.AP6Disconnect the power lead and PLUS 1 from the ELECTRON. Remove theupper half of the PLUS 1 by removing the three fixing screwsunderneath. Fit the MODULE into any free socket, with the littlenotch on the end of the EPROM, facing the rear of the PLUS 1. Takegreat care when fitting, not to bend any of the pins of the MODULE.(See the Warning above) Reassemble the PLUS 1 and refit to theELECTRON.SLOGGER ROM BOX PLUSFit the MODULE to any free socket, with the little notch on the endof the EPROM, facing the rear. Take great care when fitting, not tobend any of the pins of the MODULE. (See the Warning above)TESTINGTurn on and type *HELP. A list of ROM  titles should appear. If THEADVANCED BASIC EDITOR is not listed check that the MODULE is fittedcorrectly and none of the pins are damaged.ÄPENOTETHE ADVANCED BASIC EDITOR is a language. On switch on, the ABEmight be entered automatically. If this is not acceptable changethe priority of the ROMs by moving the ABE module to a lowerpriority socket.ÄCERELEASE NOTES  Known Problems   V 1.0*ROMID  --  When this command is used with some ROMs, spuriouscharacters are produced at the end of the line.*ROMID :drive  --  Not working in this version.NOTEIf you find undocumented features!Please contact PRES Ltd. and give as many details as possible.
